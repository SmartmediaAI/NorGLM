This github repo is for the resources related to our paper: NLEBench+NorGLM: A Comprehensive Empirical Analysis and Benchmark Dataset for Generative Language Models in Norwegian

Preprint paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01314

Data in the /results are used for reproducing the results in our paper.  We will soon upload the evaluation scripts and benchmark datasets.

Please note that some of the models and their fine-tuned versions will be uploaded after the acceptance of the paper.
